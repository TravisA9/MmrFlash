This is a Myanmar language learning web Application. 
[Try it out](https://travisa9.github.io/MmrFlash/)

[JW Language](https://www.jw.org/en/online-help/jw-language/) is a great general learning app for language that includes Myanmar (Burmese). However, since each language presents unique challanges I am working on this app as an additional aid. 

In the case of Myanmer the writing system is fairly complex. This makes it difficult to learn to read. If you cannot read, it becomes difficult to study without a teacher. The purpose of this app it to teach Bible Teachers to learn the language faster. For that reason, much of the content of this app is from [JW.org](https://www.jw.org).
